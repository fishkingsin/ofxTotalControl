 Description : Library for addressing "Total Control Lighting" RGB LED
               pixels from CoolNeon.com using an FTDI USB-to-serial cable
               or breakout board.  See included README.txt for background
               and detailed explanation of its use.
               Presently depends on FTDI's D2XX library (libftd2xx), which
               is closed-source.  Might change this to use the open-source
               libftdi, or perhaps an either/or compile-time switch.

 History     : 06/15/2011  Initial implementation
               06/18/2011  Cleaned up and library-ified, added throughput
                           and current statistics.
               06/28/2011  Changed overall behavior to simplify use with
                           continuous streaming data such as video.  Added
                           remapping functionality and CBUS clock mode.
               07/15/2011  Addressed an apparent issue with longer strands.
                           It seems the standard 32-bit latch packet is
                           only good for up to 64 pixels; each add'l 64
                           pixels (or subset thereof) requires an extra
                           32 bits of latch.  This is an empirical finding;
                           haven't seen it mentioned in datasheet or in
                           other code, and it's possible I might just be
                           overlooking something stupid in the code.

               gamma correction table to its default setting and issuing
               initial "all off" state to LEDs.
 Parameters  : unsigned char  Number of LED pixel strands to use.  Normally
                              1 to 7.  An 8th strand may be used only if
                              the FTDI chip is specifically configured to

                              further explanation.  It's okay to use fewer
                              than 8 strands with the CBUS clock, if the

   generally undesirable "topping off" in brightness.  Gamma correction
   applies a nonlinear function that results in a perceptually more linear
   sequence of brightness values.  TCopen() initializes the gamma curve to
   2.4, but this can be overridden by calling the following functions with

 Function    : TCsetStrandPin()
 Description : Assign one or more pins on the FTDI adapter to a specific
               pixel strand.  As with prior functions, this does not
               refresh the display; it applies only to subsequent
               TCrefresh() commands.  This is best done before TCopen().
 Parameters  : int            Strand number to change (0-7).  7 is normally
                              reserved as the serial clock line (but may
                              still be assigned to a different pin or pins).
               unsigned char  Pin(s) on FTDI adapter that will issue serial
                              data for this strand.  Pin numbers are defined
                              in p9813.h (e.g. TC_FTDI_TX refers to the TX
                              pin on the FTDI adapter).  It's permissible to
                              OR multiple pin values to have them operate
                              together, and in fact this is the library's
                              default behavior for strand #2, which is
                              mapped to both the DTR and RTS lines.
                              Different Arduino serial adapters use a
                              Different signal pin in the last position;
                              toggling both ensures compatibility with
                              both types.
 Returns     : TC_OK on success, else various error codes from header.
